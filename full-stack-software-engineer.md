## About Fintecture

We are building the next payment infrastructure, designed for the 2020ies and beyond.

We believe Open Banking is a game changer for online businesses which can finally collect payments cheaply, seamlessly and securely. Furthermore, Open Banking enables payment providers to build new and exciting Data Driven payment services which will revolutionize the online business sector. We want to be the leading provider of Open Banking driven payment services across the EU online commerce segment.

Moreover, we believe that the legacy payment infrastructure based on payment cards is obsolete. We are into revolutionizing a whole sector and have the ambition to replace payment cards on a large scale across Europe both online and offline.


## Position Summary

We are building a microservice ecosystem of applications serving a multitude of payment and data services for end users. Your role will be to help design, create new, further develop, and maintain existing services in our ecosystem both on the backend and the frontend.

These services you will create are mostly payments and data processing features which require third party integration. Thus, you will be required to be proficient in reading and writing documentation, writing tests and mocking services, creating schemas and applying API best practices.

We strive on code quality, this means you will have to put an extra effort in code readability, separation of concerns, self-explaining nomenclature, commenting and modularity.
