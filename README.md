## About Fintecture 

We are building the next payment infrastructure, designed for the 2020ies and beyond.
We believe Open Banking is a game changer for online businesses which can finally collect payments cheaply, seamlessly and securely. Furthermore, Open Banking enables payment providers to build new and exciting Data Driven payment services which will revolutionize the online business sector. We want to be the leading provider of Open Banking driven payment services across the EU online commerce segment.
Moreover, we believe that the legacy payment infrastructure based on payment cards is obsolete. We are into revolutionizing a whole sector and have the ambition to replace payment cards on a large scale across Europe both online and offline.
